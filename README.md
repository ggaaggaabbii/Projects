The PoliHack v6.0 project
--------------------
  This was a group project during the Polihack hackathon. It was meant to be a helping stick for blind people using a ultrasonic sensor to help them better know the surrounding environment using vibrations. It also used a accelerometer the staaccelerometerrted a buzzer when a dropping of the stick was detected. We also tried to implement a method which provided the ability of translating a 
gsm message in the braille alphabet so that a person can better communicate with others.
