- mouseover displays extra data about the device

- maybe login system that allows users to track their own device
      - allow users to add devices and display them all at once
      - uniquely identify devices by the mac address
- register page
- database to store the users
      - the database should keep a table with the user, password(encrypted),
        list of mac addresses associated (maybe allow just 1 device not to overcomplicate things)
- also send the mac address from the android device
- allow the user to pair a device by sending the mac address of that device
